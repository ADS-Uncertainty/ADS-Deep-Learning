# Uncertainty Propagation from Sensor Data to Deep Learning Models in Autonomous Driving
## Overview

Deep learning has been widely used in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Though significant progress has been made regarding their efficiency and accuracy, uncertainty remains a critical factor affecting ADS safety. We focus on the local path planning task~\cite{in18} in highway driving scenarios
