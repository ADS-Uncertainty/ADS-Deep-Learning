# Uncertainty Propagation from Sensor Data to Deep Learning Models in Autonomous Driving
## Overview

Deep learning has been widely used in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Though significant progress has been made regarding their efficiency and accuracy, uncertainty remains a critical factor affecting ADS safety. We focus on the local path planning task in highway driving scenarios. We use Gaussian
Processes to quantify the corresponding Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU). For epistemic uncertainty (EU), we employ two classic quantification methods, MC Dropout and Deep Ensembles.
