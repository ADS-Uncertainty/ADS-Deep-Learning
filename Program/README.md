# Usage

## Data Production
1. Run the programs in [Data Production](https://github.com/ADS-Uncertainty/ADS-Deep-Learning/tree/main/Program/Data%20Production) sequentially to generate the necessary data files.
* 1_Fixed_noise_size: Obtain the fixed random noise size used by MC Dropout and Deep Ensembles;
* 2_Fixed_noise_production: Generate the fixed random noise into a folder, and directly apply it to the trajectory data when running the program.
* 3_Safety_data_production: The calculation of Safety Metrics requires the re collection of data, as this type of data is fundamentally different from MC Dropout and Deep Ensembles.
